  <div id="about">
  <p>Hi! My name is Keri, and I'm an NYC based web developer.</p>
  <p>I've been fortunate enough to work in several different web related fields and have accumulated a diverse set of skills, ranging from HTML/CSS/PHP/JS and custom WordPress development all the way to SEO, *Internet Marketing, and Linux Server Administration.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="work">
    <p>Below are samples of my work for the last few years. Most of these sites are on WordPress, and have custom themes, plugins, or features. When it comes to WordPress, I particularly enjoy creating custom themes and working with the REST API. DOES THIS NEED MORE WORDS I also enjoy the freedom and flexibilty that comes from creating a website or app on a completely blank slate. </p>

  </div>
  <div id="skills">
    <p>The above is a sampling of some of techonology I used most often or am currently working on polishing my skills (say that better), but is not nearly exhaustive. I have a wide range of skills that include both front and back end development as well as SEO, website performance and optimization, SOMETHING ABOUT TOOLs?, and linux server administration.</p>

    <p>THIS NEEDS TO BE REWORKED: If I had to choose what my strongest skill is, I would say problem solving.// Just as, if not more important than the technical skills above, I'm also good at problem solving, being a team player, and learning by doing-- I'm not afraid to take on projects that involve technology that is new to me.</p>

    <p>I'm also a naturally curious person and believe that knowledge is power, so I'm always taking a class to working on a new skill, and lately that has been JS, specifically getting deeper into learning React and Nodejs.</p>
